        Structuring a document is easy!

            \subsubsection{Subsubsection}
            I have used the following code to get this output.
            
%                \subsubsubsection{Subsubsubsection}
%                Very deep subsection.
                
        
        \paragraph{}
        The section commands are numbered and will appear in the table of contents of your document. 
        Paragraphs aren't numbered and won't show in the table of contents. 
        Here an example output using sections
        
        \subparagraph{}
        It's very easy to structure documents into sections using LaTeX. 
        This feature also exists in Word, but most people don't use it properly.
